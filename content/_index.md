# Hey!

This is my website 👍. I am a human being with two arms, legs and eyes
that were made to look at screens. I go by he/him.

## Interests

I kind of like working on and with computers. I use NixOS on all my supported systems
because thats the only bearable way of using Linux for me.

I would like to be able to make games, but i lack the neccessary trust to let a
game engine handle my code and currently know too little about efficient 3D
rendering techniques. I would love to be competent in really low level programming
but lack the discipline to properly learn in my offtime after Uni and my job.

## Short CV

- Got my A-Levels in 2020
- Got my Bachelors in 2025
- I plan to be done with my Masters by 2027, with a specialisation in IT-Security

While going through university i also worked part time in several tech
related bussinesses.

- 2020 - 2021: a computer repair and IT admin shop
    - cleaned old computers and laptops, did some OS maintenance
    - digged through some old servers to move the data to a newer system
- 2021 - 2025: my universities IT center
    - tech support for emails (i was originally hired for this)
    - wrote a few monitoring scripts for internal services
    - built a fullstack application with django (for proper identitiy management of third parties)
    - revived an old node project (updated all the dependencies and scss import statements)
- 2025 - present: Research assistant in IT Security
    - Integrating the software of my Bachelor thesis into a more automated pipeline
    - Supporting the full time employees

Other skills i gained through university and spare time projects:

- Using Docker and deploying to a Kubernetes Cluster with Rancher and CI Pipelines
- Pandas and Numpy
- Using Databases (mostly Postgres)
- Some C knowledge (mostly used that for graph algorithms and computational geometry without libraries)
