# Hey!

This is my website üëç. I am a human being with two arms, legs and eyes
that were made to look at screens. I go by he/him.

## Interests

I kind of like working on and with computers. I use NixOS on all my supported systems
and honestly don't know why any more, but am usually reminded every time i have to
set up an Ubuntu Box and document my work process.

I would like to be able to make games, but i lack the neccessary trust to let a
game engine handle my code and currently know too little about efficient 3D
rendering techniques. The biggest factor for my interest in games is actually
the various amounts of optimizations, that can be done in that field.

## Short CV

- Got my Abitur in 2020
- Got my Bachelors in 2025
- I plan to be done with my Masters by 2027, so i can start working and afford rent

related bussinesses.

- 2020 - 2021: a computer repair and IT admin shop called bcs
    - cleaned old computers and laptops, did some OS maintenance
    - digged through some old servers to move the data to a newer system
- 2021 - 2025: my universities IT center
    - tech support for emails (i was originally hired for this)
    - wrote a few monitoring scripts for internal services
    - built a fullstack application with django (for proper identitiy management of third parties)
    - revived an old node project (updated all the dependencies and scss import statements)
- 2025 - present: Research assistant in IT Security
    - Integrating the software of my Bachelor thesis into a more automated pipeline


Other skills i gained through university and spare time projects:

- Using Docker and deploying to Kubernetes with Rancher and CI Pipelines
- Pandas and Numpy
- Misusing DataFrames as Database Tables
- Using Databases (mostly Postgres)
