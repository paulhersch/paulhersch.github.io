I recently had a meltdown again, because i felt like a useless piece of shit
after being in bed scrolling reddit (already using a client that does not give
me a personalized feed just so i cannot get lost in interesting stuff) for 1
hour. Ironically, this was after spending the previous two days on work related
stuff, so in theory i should not have had this nagging feeling of needing to do
something productive, especially since i already completed all my weekly tasks
by a thursday - in fact i should have been proud of myself for being early on
my weekly schedule and completing everything so quickly. Instead i deleted the
reddit reader app so it would be harder for me to browse this shitshow of a
social media network.

Two days later i realized why i felt like that 1 hour was wasted and why it
made me feel like shit to scroll some random feed of mildy interesting content:

- i didn't have fun
- most things i saw were depressing (r/all is mostly (American) politics)
- i could have spent this time making myself some good coffee and breakfast instead

All three reasons are actually why i deleted Instagram before, which back then
glued me to my screen for at least 2 hours a day, sometimes just sitting on the
bathroom floor and procrastinating my shower because i couldn't fill up the
porcellain throne and the dopamine hit was missing, while still feeling like
shit because i didn't do something "productive".

## What even is productivity

In the most narrow sense possible one would assume productivity with the amount
of marketable bussiness value gained in a certain timespan, but i simple refuse
to measure productivity in mere market units, as this made me go crazy after
some time. For some reason i could not help but think of the productivity and
market value lost to people in movies, like for example "how is the economy
ever gonna recover" after watching the first Avengers movie.

I would think, that productivity is a measure of how much you have done for you
in a day, no matter if it is work (debatable if it is for you or the
shareholders pockets tho) or Your free time, so this would also include actively
trying to relax after work or whatever things You do in a day.

The reason laying in bed looking at foreign politics and other peoples lives
didn't make me feel productive was probably because all those articles, videos
and pictures didn't provide me anything but distraction from getting up and
enjoying the day.

## Living without algorithmically fed content

Besides the fact that i don't use Instagram and other forms of moderated and
algorithmically curated media any more, some people in my age group usually
ask what i do in a day. To be quite honest i don't know, i usually forget what
i did and time just flew by while i was daydreaming or whatever. I haven't even
got around reading books yet, because time still flies by. Sometimes i work on
some side projects that interest me, which is probably the overall best use
of my time. I would argue, that getting outside has been easier nowadays, as
i at least got myself into a presentable state before 4pm.
