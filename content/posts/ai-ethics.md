## "The dark side of AI"

Where does all the AI data come from?

## "But programmers have responsibilities?"

This is what the average armchair AI hater will tell you, but they probably
either never had a job themselves or were already in a managing position. If
you are one of the monkeys endlessly typing away Your life until production
value is increased, you do not get to decide whos data the statistical
monstrosity is being trained on and how it is going to be used. This is the
same thing as claiming we as consumers have an impact on climate change, all
the while state sponsored big oil won't get forced into upholding the bare
minimum of natural protection, like not dumping raw oil into rainforests. And
if you won't do it, somebody else will get the needed money to silence their
conscience.

## Econ bros make every good thing bad

AI is a technology and technologies aren't bad by themselves. We don't need the
worlds biggest chatbot destroying lakes with every prompt like in the current
instance of late stage capitalism, we might just need a good NLP that
understands the average human better than linguists that piss out barely
approximating rules about natural language.
